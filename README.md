# Air Distance Calculator

The Air Distance Calculator is a simple HTML/CSS/JS program that calculates the distance between two locations on the Earth using their latitude and longitude coordinates. It utilizes the Haversine formula to accurately calculate the shortest distance between two points on a sphere.

## Features

- Calculate the air distance between two locations specified by latitude and longitude coordinates.
- Provide inputs in decimal degrees format for latitude and longitude.
- Display the distance in kilometers (km) or miles (mi).

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To run the Air Distance Calculator, make sure you have the following installed on your system:

- Python 3.x

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/Dovineowuor/Air-Distance-Claculator.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```shell
   cd Air-Distance-Claculator
   ```

3. Run the program:

   ```shell
   RUN YOUR PROGRAM ON LOCAHOST

## Usage

1. Enter the latitude and longitude coordinates for the starting location.
2. Enter the latitude and longitude coordinates for the destination location.
3. Select the unit of measurement (kilometers or miles) to display the distance.
4. The program will calculate and display the air distance between the two locations.

## Examples

```
Enter the latitude and longitude for the starting location:
Latitude: 51.5074
Longitude: -0.1278

Enter the latitude and longitude for the destination location:
Latitude: 48.8566
Longitude: 2.3522

Select the unit of measurement:
1. Kilometers
2. Miles
Choice: 1

The air distance between the two locations is 342.16 km.
```
